## Commands

- [start](/Commands/storage/account/migration/_start.md)
: Account Migration request can be triggered for a storage account to change its redundancy level. The migration updates the non-zonal redundant storage account to a zonal redundant account or vice-versa in order to have better reliability and availability. Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your storage account synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region.
